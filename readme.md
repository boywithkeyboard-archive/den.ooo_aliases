## aliases for den.ooo's modules

You can add a new alias by editing the `aliases.json` file.

```json
{
  "my-alias": "gh/user/repo"
}
```

After you're done, run `npm run check` and open a pull request with your change.

**Please note that you can only register ONE alias at a time!**

The referenced repository must be somewhat active and be targeted toward the Deno/JavaScript community.
